# tune-scrape
A simple scraper to display and allow notation on music reviews

Current implementation scrapes data from music.avclub.com and displays Headlines (as hyperlink to original article) along with a short excerpt of the article.

User can save notes to the article using the input form at the bottom of each article card. Each article currently only allows a single note; if user adds a note, any existing note will be overwritten.
